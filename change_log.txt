Here i will keep track of all changes in pong. Today I came back and couldn't remember what I was working on... so
this will be useful. I will also make several notes here.
Remark: this program is intended to be a concept/demo of a game idea. The idea is that it will be like pong except
the player is trying to bounce balls to hit enemies. I want it to be similar to a bullet hell game like Enter the
Gungeon.

xx/yy/zz: Make a keydown event. Rn, keypressed is getting called once, but the classicPaddle keeps turning because degrees
is 5 until the key is released. So, each tick it's turning 5 degrees. This mimics keydown, but only because of how I
coded the logic to update.

12/2/19: Modified Ball.java to use xPoints and yPoints array. Also worked on reflection on TurnPaddle. For the future,
work on improving the reflection. Right now, the ball is still distorted after rotations.

12/3/19: I think the ball is distorted for this reason: after we rotate the ball and classicPaddle, when we check to see
what part of the classicPaddle the ball hit and then calculate the result, we do not maintain the orientation of the ball.
If step 1 is hitting the classicPaddle, step 2 is rotating the ball and classicPaddle, step 3 is calculating the result, then the
orientation of the ball is not being preserved as we move from step 2 to 3.

12/7/19: I think based on the code, you should expect just a simple horizontal translation to the left after the ball
is rotated and hit detection and before the ball and classicPaddle are rotated to their original positions. But it's not
a left translation. Why?

12/23/19: I think part of the issue is that you're comparing an object that doesn't rotate (the ball) to an object that
does. When you rotate the objects to their "non rotated positions" the classicPaddle will be upright but the ball will be
rotated relative to its "original position"

1/5/20: So last time (forgot to write an update) I started writing functions for cases for when every side of the ball
hits the classicPaddle in a certain way. While someday I'd like to create a solution for this square ball, I think it's time
for me to create a circle ball which may be easier to solve so that I can actually make this game.

Working with the circle ball leaves me wondering if the graphics framework is sufficient. Ovals are made similarly to
squares, and I found squares inadequate so I switched to polygons. Maybe I should juts learn C++? I'd hate to scrap
this java project... maybe I'm not thinking creatively enough?

1/8/20: I think I am on the right track with Ball.java. I think i will continue to write cases for each side of the
ball. I added code for the cases but they might be wrong and they definitely aren't finished.

1/10/20: Decided to send it with the current state of the TurnPaddle.java class... just gonna leave it unfinished and
buggy for now so I can get to other things--tbh it's still fun even if it's not polished. Worked on making a main menu
and pause button. When you pause the game, it pauses the ball and timer, and when you go back to the game, the timer is
at the same time it was when you paused and the game does a little countdown before the ball goes zooming again. There
is a bug where if the ball's speed is slow enough then the code I wrote to keep it stationary for the countdown doesn't
really work. In the future will make an enemy type and a spawner. I'm hoping I can finish this up to be a "demo" of what
I imagined and then someday I will make it good.

1/22/20: Made classes for enemies Enemy_V and Enemy_H. The idea is that Enemy_H will spawn balls and the player will
have to reflect the balls so that they hit the enemy, and when Enemy_H gets hit, it loses part of its health. Then, when
Enemy_H loses all its health, the Spawner class spawns a new Enemy_V which has the same functionality as Enemy_H
but it's rotated clockwise 90 degrees. I made those three classes but everything is really buggy right now, so I'm
waiting to add the ball spawning functionality until those first three classes are finished. Rigght now the game isn't
even printing the debugging messages I put in Enemy_H so idk

2/7/20: Happy birthday to me! SO I fixed the bugs and they were happening because the Spawner class wasn't referencing
the right stuff and Game class wasn't even calling its tick() method. Everything is cool now but when I added more
functionality to the enemies they stopped working! I'm trying to get the Enemy_H to move back and forth and the the
ENemy_V to move up and down. But it's not working!

2/14/20: fixed the issue from before ^^^^^. Hit detection still very buggy. Need to add the feature where the
enemies spawn the balls

2/19/20: Added some documentation and uploaded to github.

3/26/20:
public void tick (boolean countdownStarted) {

        if (!game.getState().equals(mode) && !offsetOn) {
            offsetStartTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
            offsetOn = true;
        }

        if (offsetOn) {
            long elapsedOffset = System.currentTimeMillis() - offsetStartTime;
            elapsedSecondsOffset = elapsedOffset / 1000;
        }

        if (game.getState().equals(mode) && offsetOn) {
            offsetStartTime = 0;
            offsetOn = false;
            elapsedSecondsOffsetTotal += elapsedSecondsOffset;
        }

        long elapsedTime = System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime;
        elapsedSeconds = (elapsedTime / 1000) - elapsedSecondsOffsetTotal;
        //elapsedSeconds = (elapsedTime / 1000);

        if(!countdownStarted && game.getState().equals(mode)) {
            countdown();
        }
    }

Maybe when I reflect the ball off the turn classicPaddle, I need to get the angle based on the vector the ball is moving
at, where velX is the x component and velY is the y component?

3/27/20: Did a lot of refactoring, namely renaming functions/variables from something like xPoints/yPoints to
xCoordinates/yCoordinates. Mostly worked on housekeeping--made classes more abstract, namely the subclasses of
GameObject. GameObject could be better used so I wanted to do that. I also added the ability to render the GameObjects
in a particular color determined when they are constructed (I added a color field to GameObject). Most notable perhaps,
I added an additional game mode called Classic Pong so I can at least show I'm not all that stupid and can make
regular pong :p In order to do this I added a "state machine" of sorts in Game.java that will call the right tick()
and render() methods accordingly. I also make separate objects for each mode i.e. each mode has its own balls, paddles,
and so on. I added a new box in the menu screen to reflect this. Also, I made Ball.java take an ArrayList of GameObjects
so that each ball will know which GameObjects to interact with. I also added new color palettes to the main menu and
both modes. I also cleaned up my code by removing unused pieces of code and comments.
Another big update is in Timer.
I removed the function where when the user pauses the game the timer pauses. This wasn't a perfect function, and
it's not that important, so I decided to remove it until I can figure out how to make it work how I want it to. Also,
although there are two timers (one for each mode), they will show the same time in the HUD.

Bugs: 1) switching between the two modes will cause the timer to render an error on screen; and 2) the Ball-TurnPaddle
collision detection is still imperfect. I am trying to figure out how to bounce a ball off walls at arbitrary angles.
You can see above in yesterday's notes I was thinking about it a little. I ended up emailing two of my professors at
college for help: I emailed my linear algebra professor to inquire about a matrix solution and my mechanics professor
from last semester to get his perspective. My linear professor guided me towards a chapter in my textbook that might
help and my mechanics professor said the problem is very hard. I have yet to respond to them and haven't thought about
what they've said very much yet.

4/1/20: After the OOP lecture, I think what I want to do is break up GameObject into 
Interface and abstract classes. GameObject might be a good interface since it has tick()
And render() which are public, but I might need like a SimpleGameObject and 
ComplexGameObject classes.

4/5/20: Researched the separated axis theorem for collision detection and it works a lot 
better. Just need to tweak it a bit because the ball will not reflect off player1 in
Crazy mode. Also, SAT does not produce accurate results for concave shapes, so need to 
Re write the enemies so that the collision manager treats them like convex shapes.

4/6/20: Maybe implement a feature where after the ball collides with an object, it cannot collide with the same object until one second has passed? 

4/10/20: Alrighty so as of today the collision detection and SAT collision resolution is working. It's only kind of robust though, so maybe it could be improved. Right now I'm putting on the finishing touches by fixing Enemy_H and Enemy_V. I am trying to get H working first. I need to figure out how to spawn the ball every 10 seconds. Also, now that the crazy mode is getting much different from the classic mode, it is getting difficult to manage both with the same code. I need to find out if there's a way I can have two packages or something for each mode and then a package handler that still lets the player
Seamlessly switch between the two and will pause one. I also have an issue where adding the Trail into the handler makes bad things happen... so I wonder if the solution is to put a mutex lock on accessing the LinkedHashMap inside the handler?

5/31/20: I think I will have to remove the trail for now. It is opening up a can of threading worms that I do not want
to deal with. You get a ConcurrentModificationException; and fortunately the trail is not a crucial element of the game.
 I made some refactoring changes. I made it so that ComplexGameObject extends SimpleGameObject which makes it much
 easier to use the two types in the collision manager since it lets me re use code. Next I fixed Enemy_V so that it
 will render. Also, since the ball is so complex, I should either simplify it or make a new object like the ball for
 the enemies to shoot. I think I will go with the latter decision because it will be easier. I think the former would
 require a lot of editing and refactoring and I kind of want this project to be done.

 6/1/20: Finished it but in a really cheezy way. My code kept breaking itself so I did a bit of a shotty job. Onto the
 next project though. This is what happens when you don't know anything about software engineering. After taking
 my principles of programming languages class and coming back to this I'm like "wtf was I thinking..." stuff is not
 as abstract as it should be. Classes are doing too many things at once. But I have a vision of what I wanted: the
 enemies shoot balls and then you hit the enemies with the balls. THe collision is kinda cool because the balls will
 bounce off each other which I wasn't expecting.
